		<p>Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, KBE (15 October 1881 – 14 February 1975) 
		was an English humorist, whose body of work includes novels, short stories, plays, poems, song lyrics, 
		and numerous pieces of journalism. He enjoyed enormous popular success during a career that lasted more 
		than seventy years and his many writings continue to be widely read. Despite the political and social 
		upheavals that occurred during his life, much of which was spent in France and the United States, Wodehouse's 
		main canvas remained that of a pre- and post-World War I English upper-class society, reflecting his birth, 
		education and youthful writing career.</p>

	    <p>It has been well said of Bertram Wooster that, while no one views his
		flesh and blood with a keener and more remorselessly critical eye, he is
		nevertheless a man who delights in giving credit where credit is due. And
		if you have followed these memoirs of mine with the proper care, you will
		be aware that I have frequently had occasion to emphasise the fact that
		Aunt Dahlia is all right.</p>

	
		<p>She is the one, if you remember, who married old Tom Travers <i>en secondes
		noces</i>, as I believe the expression is, the year Bluebottle won the
		Cambridgeshire, and once induced me to write an article on What the
		Well-Dressed Man is Wearing for that paper she runs—<i>Milady's Boudoir.</i>
		She is a large, genial soul, with whom it is a pleasure to hob-nob. In her
		spiritual make-up there is none of that subtle gosh-awfulness which
		renders such an exhibit as, say, my Aunt Agatha the curse of the Home
		Counties and a menace to one and all. I have the highest esteem for Aunt
		Dahlia, and have never wavered in my cordial appreciation of her
		humanity, sporting qualities and general good-eggishness.</p>

		<p>This being so, you may conceive of my astonishment at finding her at my
		bedside at such an hour. I mean to say, I've stayed at her place many a
		time and oft, and she knows my habits. She is well aware that until I
		have had my cup of tea in the morning, I do not receive. This crashing in
		at a moment when she knew that solitude and repose were of the essence
		was scarcely, I could not but feel, the good old form.</p>
