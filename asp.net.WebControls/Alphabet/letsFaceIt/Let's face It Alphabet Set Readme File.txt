Let's face It Alphabet Set

This Alphabet set was designed & created by *snogirl using 
Paint Shop Pro and three fonts called "Basic Font Sample", "Berlin Sans FB Bold" and "Face It" ding font. 


You may use freely on your web pages and in scrapbooking 
and crafts, etc. You may use it on your personal correspondence also.

**Do not add to other alphabet sets or claim as your own work.**

You may share this set with others on e-mail groups but the zip 
must remain in tact with this read me file and my link button.
