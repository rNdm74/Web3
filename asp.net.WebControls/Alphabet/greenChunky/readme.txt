These icons were created with Photoshop by Laurie McCanna. If you decide that you like these icons and want to use them on your website, I do require a link back to my website in return. You can either link to the Web Diner Website at http://www.webdiner.com, or my personal website at http://www.mccannas.com You emphatically do not have permission to redistribute these icons. This all sounds harsh, but after seeing my work redistributed as part of other products without my permission I'm a changed person.

You may be familiar with http://www.mccannas.com as a great place to pick up
free art and Photoshop and CorelDraw tips. I've added some download-able
samples to my website, along with an overview of the contents of my book,
Creating Great Web Graphics. Each example is demonstrated in both Photoshop
and Corel PhotoPaint.

Creating Great Web Graphics gives basic step-by-step techniques so that the
reader can create great, professional-looking graphics in just a few short
steps, using either Photoshop or Corel PhotoPaint. Think you're not artistic?
Not a problem! This book was written for people who want to create simple
graphics easily, by following step by step examples. 

The easy-to-follow examples in the book show how to:

*create seamless pattern tiles
*create gif animations
*save a transparent gif
*colorize a black and white photo
*create bevel-eged icons
*learn how to use color to organize and enhance your website
*create 3D type with a drop shadow

The book is illustrated in full color throughout. You can order the book (Creating Great
Web Graphics, by Laurie McCanna) from your local
