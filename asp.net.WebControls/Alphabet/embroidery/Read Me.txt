Embroidery Alphabet Set

This Alphabet set was designed & created by *snogirl using 
Paint Shop Pro using the font "Embroidery" by Pizza Dude http://pizzadude.fan-a-tic.com/. 


You may use freely on your web pages and in scrapbooking 
and crafts, etc. You may use it on your personal correspondence also.

**Do not add to other alphabet sets or claim as your own work.**

You may share this set with others on e-mail groups but the zip 
must remain in tact with this read me file and my link button.
